
Dear Valued Customer,

Thank you for being an Axon user. This is a reminder that Dolby will be 
permanently bringing the Axon service to an end as of 5 PM PST on December 5, 2016. 
We know that many of you still use Axon regularly and apologize for the 
inconvenience that this may cause.

If you need a new voice chat solution, we recommend checking out either
Discord or Curse. Both offer a rich set of features and are free to use.

Please see below for a brief FAQ. Thank you very much for using Axon!

FAQ

Q. What will Dolby do with my user data?

We will be securely scrubbing all data from our servers, so your user account
and data will be deleted within one week of the service switching off on
Dec 5, 2016.


Q. If I currently have the Axon desktop client downloaded on my computer, will I
still be able to use this service?

The service requires that our servers be operational and we will be bringing
them offline permanently on Dec 5, 2016.


Q. I have a community on Axon, how can I contact them about service changes?

We are contacting all Axon users to let them know about the end of service.
If youâ€™d like to contact them yourself you can still do so via the Axon
desktop client until Dec 5, 2016.
